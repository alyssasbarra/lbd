# WASH - LMIC - 2020

This repo contains cleaned code used to generate estimates of access to Water and Sanitation facilities proportions and the number of people with access to those facility types as reported in 'Mapping geographic inequalities in access to drinking water and sanitation facilities in low- and middle-income countries, 2000â€“2017 ' published in Lancet Gobal Health on August 19, 2020. 

This repo contains three directories:

1) mbg contains general code for model based geostatistics used across Local Burden of Disease projects at IHME, as well as code specific to estimating access to water and sanitation facilities. 
2) data contains code that is specific to preparing the modeling input data. 
4) ntbk contains supplemental data processing scripts.
