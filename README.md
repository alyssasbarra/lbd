# Lymphatic filariasis prevalence - global - 2020

This repo contains cleaned code used to generate estimates of lymphatic filariasis (LF) prevalence among all ages, as published in 'The global distribution of lymphatic filariasis, 2000â€“2018: a geospatial analysis'  published in _Lancet Global Health_.

The repo contains two directories:
1) lbd_core/mbg_central - containing model-based geostatistical code similar to code used across multiple projects at IHME
2) lbd_lf - containing code specific to data cleaning and modeling for the LF prevalence analysis
