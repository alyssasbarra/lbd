# Male circumcision - Africa - 2020

This repo contains cleaned code used to generate estimates of male circumcision prevalence and the number of circumcised and uncircumcised men aged 15-49 in 38 countries in sub-Saharan Africa as reported in 'Mapping male circumcision for HIV prevention efforts in sub-Saharan Africa' published in BMC Medicine. 

This repo contains two directories:

1) lbd_core contains general code for model based geostatistics used across Local Burden of Disease projects at IHME. 
2) lbd_hiv contains code that is specific to estimating male circumcision prevalence and the number of circumcised and uncircumcised men.
